# Updates  
The link will change one in a while (when I update it) so just  
come back here if it doesnt work when you get it from another site.  
---Planned Updates---  
- More scripts and GUIs (obviously)  
- Game Recognition (So it will only load the scripts that work for the game you join  
- Custom scripts (which will be hard cuz I suck at coding)  
- Custom UIs (So you can change the colors and/or add images to the UI)  
- Some other stuff idk
